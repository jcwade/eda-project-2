# 5.  How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from
# 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?

# For a the definition of a "motor vehicle", we take the following
# EI.Sector entries:
#
# - "Mobile - On-Road Gasoline Light Duty Vehicles"
# - "Mobile - On-Road Gasoline Heavy Duty Vehicles"
# - "Mobile - On-Road Diesel Light Duty Vehicles"
# - "Mobile - On-Road Diesel Heavy Duty Vehicles"
#
# This includes vehicles such as cars and trucks but excludes aircraft, marine
# vessels, and locomotives.
#
# Our assumption is that the intent is show the pollution arising from cars and
# trucks on the streets of Baltimore.
#
# Using a linear regression model, we see a downward trend for emission levels.
