# Exploratory Data Analysis Project 2

## Getting Started

Download the datasets `summarySCC_PM25.rds` and
`Source_Classification_Code.rds`.  Place them in the same working
directory as the plot scripts.

Run R in batch mode to generate the six PNG plots:

    R CMD BATCH plot1.R
    R CMD BATCH plot2.R
	R CMD BATCH plot3.R
    R CMD BATCH plot4.R
    R CMD BATCH plot5.R
    R CMD BATCH plot6.R

On a Unix-like system, one can run

    make clean && make all

to rebuild the plots.
